# string-verification


Hello.

This repository contains a single perl script sample to be submitted as evidence of my perl coding skills.

The script "stringverify.pl" has been consructed to successfully parse through a single string containing multple substring codes, and return a list of valid codes that comply with the following criteria:

1. All codes in string must be either 12 or 14 characters in length.
2. All codes must only contain numeric characters.


As evidence that I worked personally worked on this script and did not simply copy off the internet, I have creating a Branching structure in Git to show my work as I progressed through the code writing.  I did however do some research on the internet and in a Perl Reference to to help me construct my regex matches.  That was really the only pieces I needed to look up, as I dont have all regex pattern rules pre-loaded in my memory.  It is normal for me to look up samples and do research in scripting books when I do coding at work and for play.

I began writing the code at the submission of my first commit, and completed the script with my 5th commit to the "code_test" branch and subsequent push up to develop and into master branch. I did not commit and push every file save that I did during this assignment.  I tried to encaptuate my changes based on the Steps that I listed in the script itself.

Please review the final revision and all 5 commits to the code_test branch to see how I progressed through the assignment.

Feel free to call or email me if you want  to discuss further. Thanks a lot for considering my qualifications!
